# The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization

by Peter M. Senge

## Introduction (Ch.1 1:00)

* The tools and ideas in this book are for destroying the illusion that the world is created of separate and unrelated forces
* When we give up this illusion, we can build learning organizations where new collective aspiration is set free and where people are continually learning how to learn together
* Why is this vitally important today?
  * The rate of change in today's environment is greater than its ever been and its not slowing down
  * The world is becoming increasingly interdependent, problems increasingly complex
  * Its becoming increasingly apparent our traditional, authoritarian, hierarchical business organizations fail to tap the capacities of people
* It's people that learn, not organizations, not systems

### The Beer Game (Ch.1 11:32)

* 'The Beer Game' was developed at Sloan Business School to teach Systems Thinking
* Illustrates the problems with production distribution system when there are delays
* When cause and effect are not close in time and space, our ability to connect to the two starts to fall away
* When cause and effect is immediate, we are good at learning
* When cause and effect are far apart, we have a hard time understanding the system

### Learning Disabilities (Ch.2 00:05)

* I am my position
  * When people focus on their position, they have little sense of responsibility for the entire system
* Confusion between proactive and reactive
  * True proactive means seeing our own contribution to the problems, requires seeing the whole picture

## Five Disciplines of Learning Organizations (Ch.2 5:50)

* **Personal mastery:** a discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively
* **Building shared vision:** a practice of unearthing shared pictures of the future that foster genuine commitment and enrollment rather than compliance.
* **Mental models:** deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures of images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action
* **Team learning:** starts with 'dialogue', the capacity of members of a team to suspend assumptions and enter into genuine 'thinking together'
* **Systems thinking:** The Fifth Discipline that integrates the other four

## Systems Thinking (Ch.2 4:20)

* A discipline for seeing wholes, seeing patterns of change not static snapshots
* Originated in feedback concepts of cybernetics, and in servo mechanism engineering theory dating back to the 19th century

### Types of complexity (Ch.2 8:25)

There are two types of complexity:

1. Detail complexity
2. Dynamic complexity

#### Detail complexity

* Ex. strategic plans
* Fails to provide breakthroughs because they fail to address dynamic complexity

#### Dynamic complexity

* Ex. balancing market growth and capacity expansion
* Systems thinking is seeing dynamic change, not just linear processes

### Language shapes perception (Ch.2 11:55)

* Western languages are biased toward linear view
* Consider simple system of filling a glass of water
* Linear view we say "I am filling a glass of water"
* In reality, we are operating a water regulation system with five variables
  * desired water level
  * current water level
  * gap between the two
  * facet handle position
  * water flow
* These operate in a loop of cause effect relationships, a feedback system
  * The facet position influences the water flow which influences the water level which changes the perceived gap between the desired and current water levels and that gap influences the facet handle position, to close the loop
* In Systems Thinking, we give up the idea that there must be an individual responsible, the feedback perspective suggests that everybody shares responsibility for the problems generated by a system

### Types of feedback (Ch.2 19:52)

There are two types of feedback:

1. Reinforcing feedback
2. Balancing feedback

#### Reinforcing feedback

* Ex. self fulfilling prophecy or Pygmalion Effect
  * As a manager, someone I see potential in, I pay more attention to, they do better, and my initial belief is confirmed
  * Someone I see with little potential, I ignore, they do worse, and my belief is confirmed

#### Balancing feedback

* Seeks stability, nature loves a balance
* State controlled economy fails because it severs the multiple self correcting processes that operate in a free market system
* Balancing systems are harder to see than reinforcing systems, because often there is little change to see

### Delays (Ch.2 33:10)

* One of the highest leverage points of improving system performance is minimizing delays
* Happen when the effect of one variable has a delay when effecting another
* American manufacturers came to recognize that while they worked traditionally to tightly control inventory, their Japanese counterparts have concentrated on reducing delays, a much more successful effort
* Think about a shower that takes a long time for the temperature to respond to your control adjustment

## Personal Mastery (Ch.2 36:30)

* Organizations learn only through individuals that learn
* People with a high level of person mastery:
  * see current reality as an ally, not an enemy
  * live in a continual learning mode, they never arrive
  * are acutely aware of their ignorance, their incompetence, their growth areas, and they are deeply self-confident
* Personal vision is the answer to question: "what do I truly want, what really matters to me?"
* Organizations will not have visions until individuals have visions
* Ability to see current reality objectively is every bit as vital as the capacity to articulate a vision

## Shared Vision (Ch.3 1:00)

* Personal vision leads to shared vision
* A shared vision is the answer to the question: "what do we want to create?"
* Visions that are truly shared take time to emerge, a byproduct of interactions of individual visions
  * Require ongoing conversation where individuals share their dream but learn how to listen to each others dreams
  * Listening is more difficult than talking, especially for strong willed managers with ideas of what is needed
  * Requires openness and willingness to entertain diversity of ideas, allowing multiple visions to exist
* Levels of commitment
  * Compliant - go along with the vision, but not enrolled or committed
  * Enrolled - the process of joining something by choice
  * Committed - feeling fully responsible for making the vision happen
* How to go about getting others to invest
  * Be enrolled yourself (stop selling)
  * Be on the level, don't inflate benefits or sweep problems under the rug
  * Give people the freedom to choose

## Mental Models (Ch.3 31:00)

* Mental models shape our perceptions and how we act
* The problem with mental models are when they are tacit, when we don't recognize we have them

## Team Learning (Ch.4 0:15)

* People who need one another to act are becoming the key learning unit in organizations
* Three critical dimensions:
  * Need to think insight-fully about complex issues, tap the intelligence of many minds
  * Need for innovative, coordinated action
  * Teams members on other teams for learning
* Starts with mastering the practice of dialog and discussion
  * Dialog: the free and creative of exploration of complex issues, a deep listening to one another and suspending of one's own views
  * Discussion: different views are presented and defended and there is a search for the best view to support decisions that must be made at the time
* A sustained emphasis on winning is not compatible with giving first priority to coherence and truth
* Three basic conditions that are necessary for dialog:
  * All participants must suspend their assumptions
  * All participants must regard one another as colleagues
  * There must be a facilitator who holds the context of dialog

## Getting Started (Ch.4 43:10)

* How can we overcome the politics, the games, the back biting?
* First step is always with individuals, don't bury these concerns
* Current reality is just current reality, its not good or bad, it just is
* Start with the question, where are our partners?
* Groups who can start to learn are the groups who have some power to take action
* Learning is always about taking action
