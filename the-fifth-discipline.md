# The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization

by Peter M. Senge

## Chapter 1 - How Our Actions Create Our Reality And How We Can Change It

* It's people that learn, not organizations, not systems
* The 'Beer Game' developed at Sloan Business School teaches systems thinking
* When cause and effect are not close in time and space, our ability to connect to the two starts to fall away. When cause and effect is immediate, we are good at learning. When cause and effect are far apart, we have a hard time understanding the system

## Chapter 2 - The Fifth Discipline: The Cornerstone Of The Learning Organization

### Learning Disabilities

* I am my position
  * When people focus on their position, they have little sense of responsibility for the entire system
* Confusion between proactive and reactive
  * True proactive means seeing our own contribution to the problems, requires seeing the whole picture

### Systems Thinking (4:20)

* A discipline for seeing wholes, not static snapshots
* Originated in feedback concepts of cybernetics, and in servo mechanism engineering theory dating back to the 19th century
* Systems Thinking is the Fifth Discipline

### Five Disciplines (5:50)

* **Personal mastery:** a discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively
* **Building shared vision:** a practice of unearthing shared pictures of the future that foster genuine commitment and enrollment rather than compliance.
* **Mental models:** deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures of images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action
* **Team learning:** starts with 'dialogue', the capacity of members of a team to suspend assumptions and enter into genuine 'thinking together'
* **Systems thinking:** The Fifth Discipline that integrates the other four

### Types of complexity (8:25)

There are two types of complexity:

1. Detail complexity
2. Dynamic complexity

#### Detail complexity

* Ex. strategic plans
* Fails to provide breakthroughs because they fail to address dynamic complexity

#### Dynamic complexity

* Ex. balancing market growth and capacity expansion
* Systems thinking is seeing dynamic change, not just linear processes

### Language shapes perception (11:55)

* Western languages are biased toward linear view
* Consider simple system of filling a glass of water
* Linear view we say "I am filling a glass of water"
* In reality, we are operating a water regulation system with five variables
  * desired water level
  * current water level
  * gap between the two
  * facet handle position
  * water flow
* These operate in a loop of cause effect relationships, a feedback system
  * The facet position influences the water flow which influences the water level which changes the perceived gap between the desired and current water levels and that gap influences the facet handle position, to close the loop
* In Systems Thinking, we give up the idea that there must be an individual responsible, the feedback perspective suggests that everybody shares responsibility for the problems generated by a system

### Types of feedback (19:52)

There are two types of feedback:

1. Reinforcing feedback
2. Balancing feedback

#### Reinforcing feedback

* Ex. self fulfilling prophecy or Pygmalion Effect
  * As a manager, someone I see potential in, I pay more attention to, they do better, and my initial belief is confirmed
  * Someone I see with little potential, I ignore, they do worse, and my belief is confirmed

#### Balancing feedback

* Seeks stability, nature loves a balance
* State controlled economy fails because it severs the multiple self correcting processes that operate in a free market system
* Balancing systems are harder to see than reinforcing systems, because often there is little change to see

### Delays (33:10)

* One of the highest leverage points of improving system performance is minimizing delays
* Happen when the effect of one variable has a delay when effecting another
* American manufacturers came to recognize that while they worked traditionally to tightly control inventory, their Japenese counterparts have concentrated on reducing delays, a much more successful effort
* Think about a shower that takes a long time for the temperature to respond to your control adjustment

### Personal Mastery (36:30)

* Organizations learn only through individuals that learn
* People with a high level of person mastery live in a continual learning mode, they never arrive
* People with a high level of personal mastery are acutely aware of their ignorance, their incompetence, their growth areas, and they are deeply self-confident
* Personal mastery is a process, a lifelong discipline

### TODO: Creative Tension???

## Chapter 3 - The Core Disciplines: Building The Learning Organization

### Shared Vision (1:00)

* Personal vision leads to shared vision
* At its simplest level, a shared vision is the answer to the question "what do we want to create?"
* TODO: Leaders need to listen
* TODO: Levels
  * Compliant
  * Enrolled
  * Committed

### Governing Ideas (17:30)

* Vision, Purpose (or Mission), and Core Values
* Vision is the what, Purpose (or Mission) is the why, Core Values is the how
* Taken as a unit, all three governing ideas answer the question "what do we believe in?"

### Mental Models (31:00)

* Mental models are active and shape how we act
* TODO: examples
* TODO: tie back to systems thinking, feedback

### Advocacy vs. Inquiry (58:??)

* TODO

## Chapter 4 - Reflections From Practice

### Team Learning (0:15)

* People who need one another to act are becoming the key learning unit in organizations
* Three critical dimensions:
  * Need to think insightfully about complex issues, tap the intelligence of many minds
  * Need for innovative, coordinated action
  * Teams members on other teams for learning
* Starts with mastering the practice of dialog and discussion
  * Dialog: the free and creative of exploration of complex issues, a deep listening to one another and suspending of one's own views
  * Discussion: different views are presented and defended and there is a search for the best view to support decisions that must be made at the time
* A sustained emphasis on winning is not compatible with giving first priority to coherence and truth
* Three basic conditions that are necessary for dialog:
  * All participants must suspend their assumptions
  * All participants must regard one another as colleagues
  * There must be a facilitator who holds the context of dialog

### Getting Started (Ch4 43:10)

* How can we overcome the politics, the games, the back biting?
* First step is always with individuals, don't bury these concerns
* Current reality is just current reality, its not good or bad, it just is
* Start with the question, where are our partners?
* Groups who can start to learn are the groups who have some power to take action
* Learning is always about taking action
