# The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization

by Peter M. Senge

## Chapter 1

* It's people that learn, not organizations, not systems
* The 'Beer Game' developed at Sloan Business School teaches systems thinking
* When cause and effect are not close in time and space, our ability to connect to the two starts to fall away. When cause and effect is immediate, we are good at learning. When cause and effect are far apart, we have a hard time understanding the system

## Chapter 2

### Learning Disabilities

* I am my position
  * When people focus on their position, they have little sense of responsibility for the entire system
* Confusion between proactive and reactive
  * True proactive means seeing our own contribution to the problems, requires seeing the whole picture

### Systems Thinking (4:20)

* A discipline for seeing wholes, not static snapshots
* Originated in feedback concepts of cybernetics, and in servo mechanism engineering theory dating back to the 19th century
* Systems Thinking is the Fifth Discipline

### Five Disciplines (5:50)

* **Personal mastery:** a discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively
* **Building shared vision:** a practice of unearthing shared pictures of the future that foster genuine commitment and enrollment rather than compliance.
* **Mental models:** deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures of images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action
* **Team learning:** starts with 'dialogue', the capacity of members of a team to suspend assumptions and enter into genuine 'thinking together'
* **Systems thinking:** The Fifth Discipline that integrates the other four

### Types of complexity (8:25)

There are two types of complexity:

1. Detail complexity
2. Dynamic complexity

#### Detail complexity

* Ex. strategic plans
* Fails to provide breakthroughs because they fail to address dynamic complexity

#### Dynamic complexity

* Ex. balancing market growth and capacity expansion
* Systems thinking is seeing dynamic change, not just linear processes

### Language shapes perception (11:55)

* Western languages are biased toward linear view
* Consider simple system of filling a glass of water
* Linear view we say "I am filling a glass of water"
* In reality, we are operating a water regulation system with five variables
  * desired water level
  * current water level
  * gap between the two
  * facet handle position
  * water flow
* These operate in a loop of cause effect relationships, a feedback system
  * The facet position influences the water flow which influences the water level which changes the perceived gap between the desired and current water levels and that gap influences the facet handle position, to close the loop
* In Systems Thinking, we give up the idea that there must be an individual responsible, the feedback perspective suggests that everybody shares responsibility for the problems generated by a system

### Types of feedback (19:52)

There are two types of feedback:

1. Reinforcing feedback
2. Balancing feedback

#### Reinforcing feedback

* Ex. self fulfilling prophecy or Pygmalion Effect
  * As a manager, someone I see potential in, I pay more attention to, they do better, and my initial belief is confirmed
  * Someone I see with little potential, I ignore, they do worse, and my belief is confirmed

#### Balancing feedback

* Seeks stability, nature loves a balance
* State controlled economy fails because it severs the multiple self correcting processes that operate in a free market system
* Balancing systems are harder to see than reinforcing systems, because often there is little change to see

### Delays (33:10)

* One of the highest leverage points of improving system performance is minimizing delays
* Happen when the effect of one variable has a delay when effecting another
* Think about a shower that takes a long time for the temperature to respond to your control adjustment
